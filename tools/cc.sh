# vcvars is deliberately not used: it hangs when invoked from Git Bash on this
# machine, so cl gets the include and library directories as explicit flags.
# For the same reason cl does NOT go through tools/lowpri.sh - `cmd /c start`
# hangs forever here as soon as it launches an MSVC tool.  Nothing is lost:
# these builds are a handful of files with no parallelism to starve the
# desktop with.
#
# Everything cl is told goes into a response file, one argument per line, so
# that the spaces in "Program Files" survive without a layer of eval quoting.
